* Fancy URLs Menu.

[[https://melpa.org/#/fancy-urls-menu][file:https://melpa.org/packages/fancy-urls-menu-badge.svg]]

The Fancy URLs Menu (previously Fancy FFAP Menu) provides a way of finding URLs in the current buffer and opening them in a browser of your choosing.

This package was written because of the limitations of the src_elisp{ffap-menu} command of the FFAP package (Find File At Point!  Get your brain out of the gutter!) and uses the src_elisp{ffap-menu-rescan} function to assemble the list of URLs in the current buffer.

It also derives from src_elisp{Tabulated-list-mode}, so it is similar in user experience to src_elisp{list-buffers}, src_elisp{list-processes}, and src_elisp{list-packages}, as all three derive from src_elisp{Tabulated-list-mode}.
