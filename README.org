* Fancy FFAP URLs Menu.

The Fancy FFAP (Find File At Point!  Look it up, it's legit and not at all a cheeky joke!) URLs Menu is used to view and choose the URLs visible in the current buffer for opening in a browser (EWW, links2, or something horrid like Firefox).

Currently only src_elisp{fancy-ffap-menu-list-urls} works.

** Installation.

*** Manual installation.

First clone and open the package with emacs:

#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://codeberg.org/kakafarm/emacs-fancy-ffap-menu/
#+end_src

Now, in Emacs, run the command ~package-install-from-file~ and choose the file =emacs-fancy-ffap-menu/fancy-ffap-menu.el= in the cloned repository.
