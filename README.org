* Fancy FFAP URLs Menu.

The Fancy FFAP (Find File At Point!  Look it up, it's legit and not at all a cheeky joke!) URLs Menu is used to view and choose the URLs visible in the current buffer for opening in a browser (EWW, links2, or something horrid like Firefox).

Currently only src_elisp{fancy-ffap-menu-list-urls} works.
